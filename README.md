# guessing-game
On friday Ron and Dave added css styling and an array to the repo. In this instance Dave was the driver and Ron was the navigator.
On Thursday Luc and Ron are doing a partner pair assignment and Luc changed the html by printing to the site rather than an alert message. Also Luc added the questions into functions. Luc will be pushing this copy to GitHub with these revisions. 

The author of this program is Ron Dunphy. This is a demo for class 201d5. This is a guessing game created with HTML and JavaScript. There will be one question were you will be asked to guess a number between 1 -10, until you guess correctly. The user will be asked 3 yes or no questions about the creator of the game, and one regarding the band The Meters. Your correct answers will be tallied and displayed in a prompt box at the end of the game.
